Hi! I'm **Suleman Munawar**, a Computational Science and Engineering graduate student passionate about building intelligent, efficient, and future-ready systems. My work sits at the intersection of communication, computation, and AI, with a focus on **vehicular networks, edge computing, RIS, LEO satellites**, and **energy-efficient machine learning**.

I'm currently completing my Master's from <a href='https://sines.nust.edu.pk'>**SINES**</a> in **NUST, Pakistan**, and pursuing a **research mobility program at <a href='https://frederick.ac.cy/en'>Frederick University</a>, Cyprus**, funded by **Erasmus+**. My academic experience includes multiple **IEEE publications** in cutting-edge domains like RIS-assisted vehicular networks and DNN-based task offloading for edge computing.

My goal is clear: to apply this knowledge and research experience in the **tech industry**, in roles that involve solving **real-world problems with high-impact technologies**, whether that's working on **autonomous vehicles, AI/ML systems, cloud-edge integration**, or **intelligent infrastructure**.

I've also worked in front-end development, data analytics, and software testing, giving me a well-rounded understanding of software systems. I'm actively seeking **full-time opportunities or research-intensive roles** where I can grow, contribute, and build impactful solutions that reflect my skills and interests.

When I'm not working, you'll probably find me playing piano 🎹, sketching 🖼️, skateboarding 🛹, riding my bike 🏍️, or exploring the world of motorsports (one day I plan to hit the racetrack too 🏎️💨).
