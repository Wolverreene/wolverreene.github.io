  abstract={Cooperative, Connected, and Automated Mobility (CCAM) is based on fast, secure, and reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication to enable collective perception and maneuver coordination in autonomous driving. However, high-frequency wireless communication, particularly in the millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) bands, is highly susceptible to environmental obstacles, leading to severe signal attenuation and communication delays. This study investigates the integration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) into vehicular networks to mitigate these challenges and analyzes their impact on Age of Information (AoI) and Peak AoI (PAoI) metrics. The latter metrics are highly relevant to feedback delays introduced in the Cooperative Control Schemes of Autonomous Vehicles, which are well known to compromise their stability. Their characterization is thus crucial for the performance assessment of the automatic controllers with this characterization in the presence of RIS not investigated as of now in the literature. Using the All-or-Nothing Receiver Model (ANRM) and Distance-Dependent Propagation Model (DDPM), we extend AoI formulations by incorporating RIS path loss characteristics revealing that RIS-assisted networks significantly reduce AoI and PAoI values, enabling reliable cooperative control in vehicular systems. We consider a cooperative merging maneuver on an intersection as our test case and demonstrate that the effect of the introduced delays on the cooperative control scheme performance is minimal. Passive RISs are assumed throughout the study, due to their energy efficient operation as compared to active metasurfaces.},

  title={Cooperative computational offloading in mobile edge computing for vehicles: A model-based dnn approach},
  author={Munawar, Suleman and Ali, Zaiwar and Waqas, Muhammad and Tu, Shanshan and Hassan, Syed Ali and Abbas, Ghulam},
  abstract = {Many advancements are being made in vehicular networks, such as self-driving, dynamic route scheduling, real-time traffic condition monitoring, and on-board infotainment services. However, these services require high computation power and precision and can be met using mobile edge computing (MEC) mechanisms for vehicular networks. MEC operates through the edge servers available at the roadside, also known as roadside units (RSU). MEC is very useful for vehicular networks because it has extremely low latency and supports operations that require near-real-time access to rapidly changing data. This paper proposes an efficient computational offloading, smart division of tasks, and cooperation among RSUs to increase service performance and decrease the delay in a vehicular network via MEC. The computational delay is further reduced by parallel processing. In the division of tasks, each task is divided into two sub-components which are fed to a deep neural network (DNN) for training. Consequently, this reduces the overall time delay and overhead. We also adopt an efficient routing policy to deliver the results through the shortest path to improve service reliability. The offloading, computing, division, and routing policies are formulated, and a model-based DNN approach is used to obtain an optimal solution. Simulation results prove that our proposed approach is suitable in a dynamic environment. We also compare our results with the existing state-of-the-art, showing that our proposed approach outperforms the existing schemes.},

  title={Intelligent task offloading for smart devices in mobile edge computing},
  author={Saleem, Osama and Munawar, Suleman and Tu, Shanshan and Ali, Zaiwar and Waqas, Muhammad and Abbas, Ghulam},
  abstract={Mobile edge computing (MEC) is used for compu-tationally complex applications by offloading it to the nearby edge server either partially or entirely. The problem arises of selecting whether the component is to be offloaded to the mobile edge server (MES) for execution, or it needs to be executed locally. Therefore, we propose a time-efficient decision offloading scheme (TEDOS) to derive a data set and train an artificial neural network (ANN) on the derived data set. TEDOS provide the smart decision on the optimal permutation of the divided components based on delay. We developed a mathematical model for delays in communication, execution and component queuing. We obtained a final delay for all possible permutations of component offloading policies. Our model obtained 91 % accurate results as compared to the existing schemes. The simulation result shows that our proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art.},
